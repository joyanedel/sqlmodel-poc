# SQL Model
This project is just about learning SQLModel by @tiangolo.
Consider this repository as a prove of concept, a exploratory code
to evaluate if this library accomplish with some of my expectations
and / or find new ways to do things.

## Technologies
This project uses:
* Python ^3.10
* SQLModel
* Mypy
* SQLite

## In the future
To this prove of concept, i'd like to add tests. Specifically tests
that `test` unit of behaviors, not unit tests that `test` unit of codes.
The library i'll use for this is `pytest` for its great power as a test runner
